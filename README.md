##PROJECT: Push Button Counter
A Push Button Counter using an ESP32 and an OLED display is a simple and educational project. It demonstrates interfacing hardware components, using GPIO pins, and displaying data on an OLED screen. Here's an overview

## Objective
Create a counter that increments or decrements when a push button is pressed, with the count displayed on an OLED screen.

## Components Required
ESP32 - Microcontroller for processing.
Push Button(s) - To increment and decrement the counter.
OLED Display - To show the counter value.
Resistors (10kÎ©) - Pull-down resistors for the buttons.
Jumper Wires - For connections.
Breadboard - For prototyping.

## Key Features
Increment/Decrement Counter: Use one button to increment the counter and another to decrement it.
Reset Counter: Optional feature to reset the counter to zero using a third button.
Display Output: Real-time counter value displayed on the OLED screen.
Debouncing: Software or hardware debouncing to handle unintended multiple presses.
